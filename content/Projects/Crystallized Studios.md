## My Contributions

### Programming

- Increased usability and reduced run time performance by 50%, substituting the standard projectiles physics engine with a custom-built, more efficient projectile and raycast system, grounded in advanced mathematics and physics principles
- Fixed errors in character animation implementation, enhancing the productâ€™s professionalism and consumer satisfaction by working closely with team members, diagnosing issues in server code, and removing such bugs.
- Secured potential memory leaks, counteracting user led server crashes with multithreading

### 3D Modelling

- Made numerous low poly 3D models of characters and weapons, guaranteeing an enjoyable experience for low-end devices, by focusing on low triangle count and clean topology.

- Adjusted the models as per requests, which guarantees satisfaction among superiors, achieved through daily communication and frequent voice calls.
