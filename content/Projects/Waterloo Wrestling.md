## My Contributions


### ReactJS

- Led the redevelopment of the Waterloo Wrestling Club website as the lead programmer, resulting in increased customer engagement and membership sign-ups by redecorating and collaborating with the coaches.
- Optimized the website's performance and accessibility, achieving decrease in load times by diagnosing issues, and transitioning from JavaScript to ReactJS.
- Enhanced the website's functionality user experience, leading to a substantial increase in website traffic, by fixing its ReactJS-induced UI bugs and iterating through multiple prototypes for the website UI.
- Streamlined the development process and enhanced productivity, significantly reducing potential meeting hours by leveraging insights from the SDLC and excellent communication.
