## My Contributions

### Programming

- Built the "planting system" for every crop in the game, ensuring interactive playability with keyboard and mouse inputs, by implementing clientsided and serversided events.

    - Multilevel planting system includes watering, fertilizing, and harvesting the plants at specific intervals of time.

### 3D Modelling

- Made numerous low poly 3D models of farming paraphernalia and plants, guaranteeing an enjoyable experience for low-end devices, by focusing on low triangle count and clean topology.

- Adjusted the models as per requests, which guarantees satisfaction among superiors, achieved through daily communication and frequent voice calls.
